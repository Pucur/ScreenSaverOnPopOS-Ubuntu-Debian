# ScreenSaverOnPopOS-Ubuntu-Debian
This is a simple script that turns on the screensavers when nothing on full screen.
By default, if you away from the PC for 2 min, the screensaver will shows up.
If you away for 15 mins, the PC will locks out.
If you away for 30 mins, the PC will go sleep.

Packages needed for this:
xfce4-screensaver (im using this because its prettier than xscreensaver login screen)
xdg-utils
xprintidle

Simply suggest to run this script in the background with bash idle.sh, also needs to run xfce4-screensaver at startup.

If has any question, feel free to send me a message.
